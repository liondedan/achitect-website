### Hero Section (`Hero.tsx`)
**Title:** Architectural Designer in Pembrokeshire & West Wales
**Subtitle:** I’m a Welsh-speaking architectural designer with over 30 years of experience — the last three decades running my own practice in West Wales.
**Body:**
I’ve worked across the UK, but what I love most is creating homes that feel right for the people who live in them. Now working independently, I focus on extensions, renovations, and one-off homes that are designed to be lived in.
With deep local knowledge and long-standing relationships across the region, I offer a hands-on, practical approach — from first ideas to final details.

### About Me Content (`AboutMeContent.tsx`)
**Section Title:** A Life in Architecture — Rooted in Wales
**Biography:** I’ve worked in architecture for over 30 years. After studying in Cardiff and travelling across Europe to explore design and buildings, I began my career in Cambridge before returning to Pembrokeshire to set up my own practice — which I’ve run ever since.
**Design Philosophy:**
Over the years, I’ve worked on everything from city flats and commercial projects to listed buildings and rural new-builds. But it’s the work with families and individuals that I find most rewarding — helping shape homes that are practical, personal, and built to last.

Born and raised here in West Wales, I know the planning systems, the landscape, and the people. I’m a fluent Welsh speaker and work closely with local professionals and trades — helping move projects forward with confidence and care.

Having designed and built several homes and extensions for myself, I also understand the process from a client’s perspective — the decisions, the costs, the excitement. If you’re planning something new, I’d love to help make it happen.

## Portfolio Page (`portfolio.tsx`)

**Page Title:** Portfolio – Architectural Design Work
**Meta Description:** A selection of my featured work as an architectural designer.

**Header:** My Work
**Introductory Text:**
Over the past 30 years, I’ve worked on a broad mix of projects — from modern homes and traditional renovations to commercial and rural buildings. While each project is unique, they all share a common thread: a practical, thoughtful approach, shaped by experience and an understanding of how people really use space.
Here are some of the project types I’ve worked on:

### Portfolio Sections (`PortfolioSection.tsx`)

**Section 1: Homes & Extensions**
**Text:** From full new-builds to modest additions, I help clients create homes that feel right — designed around how you live now, and how you might grow into them in future.

**Section 2: Barn Conversions & Rural Projects**
**Text:** Breathing new life into existing structures while respecting the landscape, history and fabric of the original building — whether traditional stone barns or agricultural outbuildings.

**Section 3: Listed Buildings & Conservation Areas**
**Text:** Carefully considered design within sensitive contexts — including working with conservation officers, listed building consent applications, and detailing that respects a building’s heritage.

**Footer Text:** If you’d like to know more about any of these types of projects, or discuss something specific you have in mind, I’d be happy to chat.

**Page Title:** A Practical, Supportive Approach – Architectural Design
**Meta Description:** A Practical, Supportive Approach as an architectural designer — From First Ideas to Final Details

**Header:** A Practical, Supportive Approach — From First Ideas to Final Details
**Introductory Text:**
Every project is different — but whether you’re planning a small extension or a full new-build, the journey should feel clear, collaborative, and well-supported.
With over 30 years of experience — and strong working relationships with local authorities, consultants and trades — I guide clients through the process step by step, making sure things stay on track and stress is kept to a minimum.
Here’s how I typically work:

### Process Steps (`process.ts`)
*   **Initial Chat:** A free, informal conversation — in person or by phone — to explore your ideas, budget, and what might be possible.
*   **Site Visit & Brief:** I visit the site, get to know how you live and what you need, then prepare a brief to guide the design.
*   **Concept Design:** Sketches and ideas to bring your project to life. We refine things together until it feels right.
*   **Planning & Permissions:** I prepare and submit drawings for planning or listed building consent, and liaise with the local authority on your behalf.
*   **Detailed Design:** More technical drawings and coordination with engineers or specialists as needed — ready for construction.
*   **On-site Support:** Help with choosing builders, reviewing quotes, and staying involved during the build — as much or as little as you need.

**Concluding Text:**
No two projects are the same — but my goal is always to keep things clear, grounded, and built around you.
If you’re at the start of a project, or even just thinking about what’s possible, feel free to get in touch.

### Services (`process.ts`)
*   **Residential Design:** I offer custom home design, renovations, and additions tailored to your lifestyle.
*   **Commercial Architecture:** I provide innovative and functional design for offices, retail spaces, and other commercial properties.
*   **Feasibility Studies:** I conduct a comprehensive analysis of your project's potential, including site evaluation, zoning research, and budget analysis.
*   **Interior Design:** I create cohesive and beautiful spaces through holistic interior design services.
