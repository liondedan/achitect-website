# Engineering Plan: SITE-002 - Project Portfolio Showcase

## 1. High-Level Strategy

The goal is to create a new page at `/portfolio` that displays a gallery of the architect's projects. For this initial version, we will use a static, hard-coded array of project data. This allows us to build the UI and meet the story's requirements without needing a backend or database. The page will be visually consistent with the existing homepage and will handle the case where no projects are available to display.

## 2. Engineering Tasks

- **TASK-002A: Create Portfolio Page**: Create a new page file at `achitect-website/src/pages/portfolio.tsx`. This page will serve as the container for the project gallery. (done)
- **TASK-002B: Define Project Data Structure**: Create a TypeScript interface for a `Project` object. It should include `id`, `title`, `description`, and `imageUrl`. (done)
- **TASK-002C: Create Mock Project Data**: Create a file with a hard-coded array of `Project` objects to use for development and initial display. (done)
- **TASK-002D: Create Project Thumbnail Component**: Build a reusable React component that takes a `Project` object as a prop and displays its image, title, and description. (done)
- **TASK-002E: Build Project Gallery Component**: Create a component that takes an array of `Project` objects, maps over them, and renders a `ProjectThumbnail` for each one. (done)
- **TASK-002F: Implement Empty State**: Add logic to the portfolio page to display a user-friendly message when the project list is empty, as per the BDD scenario. (done)
- **TASK-002G: Add Navigation Link**: Update the `Header` component to include a navigation link to the new `/portfolio` page. (done)

## 3. Technical Notes

- **Styling**: All new components should use CSS Modules and follow the existing design language established by the homepage for consistency.
- **Data Source**: The project data is static for now. A future story will likely involve fetching this data from a headless CMS or a backend API.
- **Image Optimization**: Use the `next/image` component for all project images to ensure they are optimized for performance.

## 4. Risks and Dependencies

- **Risk**: Large, unoptimized images could negatively impact page load times. Mitigation: Use `next/image` and ensure appropriate image sizes are used.
- **Dependency**: The design of the project thumbnails may require input from a designer to ensure they are visually appealing and effective.
