# Engineering Plan: SITE-004 - About Me Page

## 1. High-Level Strategy

The objective is to build a performant and highly optimized "About Me" page at the `/about` route. This page will introduce the architect to potential clients by displaying a professional photo, a biography, and a design philosophy. The plan includes advanced SEO techniques like structured data (Schema.org) and social media optimization (Open Graph), alongside performance features like image placeholders. We will follow the existing architecture, using Next.js and creating reusable React components with static content.

## 2. Engineering Tasks

-   **TASK-004A: Create 'About' Page**: Create a new page file at `achitect-website/src/pages/about.tsx`. (done)
-   **TASK-004B: Implement Core SEO Metadata**: Use the `next/head` component to add a unique `<title>` and `<meta name="description">`. (done)
-   **TASK-004C: Add Open Graph Tags**: Within `next/head`, implement Open Graph tags (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`) to control how the page appears when shared on social media. (done)
-   **TASK-004D: Implement JSON-LD Structured Data**: Add a `<script type="application/ld+json">` tag to the page with `Person` schema markup to describe the architect to search engines, improving the chances of rich results. (done)
-   **TASK-004E: Define 'About Me' Data Structure**: Create a TypeScript interface for an `AboutMe` object, including fields for `imageUrl`, `biography`, `designPhilosophy`, and a descriptive `imageAltText`. (done)
-   **TASK-004F: Create Mock 'About Me' Data**: Create a file with a hard-coded `AboutMe` object. (done)
-   **TASK-004G: Develop 'About Me' Components**: Create the necessary React components, ensuring the use of semantic HTML (`<article>`, `<section>`) and that the architect's photo receives descriptive alt text. (done)
-   **TASK-004H: Implement Image Placeholder**: Configure the `next/image` component to show a blurred placeholder while the main image is loading. (done)
-   **TASK-004I: Integrate Components and Data**: Assemble the page in `about.tsx`. (done)
-   **TASK-004J: Add Navigation Link**: Update the `Header` component with a link to `/about`. (done)

## 3. Technical Notes

-   **SEO**: A multi-faceted approach to SEO is key. This includes on-page metadata, structured data for rich results, and Open Graph tags for social sharing. Semantic HTML remains crucial.
-   **Performance**: The `next/image` component with placeholders is the primary tool for performance optimization on this page.
-   **Data Structure**: The data structure will now include `imageAltText` to ensure this important accessibility and SEO attribute is not overlooked.

## 4. Risks and Dependencies

-   **Dependency**: Requires a professional headshot and finalized text for the biography and design philosophy sections.
-   **Dependency**: Accurate information (name, job title, etc.) is needed for the JSON-LD schema.
-   **Risk**: The layout may need adjustments once the final content is provided.
