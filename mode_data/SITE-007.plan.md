# Engineering Plan: SITE-007 - Mobile Responsive Viewing

## 1. Engineering Tasks

- **TASK-007A: Refactor Header for Mobile** (DONE)
  - Implement a hamburger menu button that is only visible on screens narrower than 768px.
  - Add state management (`useState`) to the `Header` component to control the visibility of the mobile menu.
  - Create a full-screen overlay for the navigation links when the hamburger menu is active.
  - Ensure navigation links in the overlay are easily tappable.

- **TASK-007B: Adjust Global and Page Layouts** (DONE)
  - Review and update the main layouts and `globals.css` to support a mobile-first approach.
  - Ensure all page content renders in a single-column layout on screens narrower than 768px.

- **TASK-007C: Make Components Responsive** (DONE)
  - **Hero Component:** Adjust font sizes, spacing, and image scaling for mobile view.
  - **ProjectGallery & ProjectThumbnail:** Ensure the gallery items stack vertically and thumbnails scale correctly.
  - **AboutMeContent:** Adapt the layout to a single column, ensuring the image and text are legible.
  - **ProcessTimeline & ProcessStepCard:** Modify the timeline to a linear, vertical layout suitable for mobile.
  - **ServiceList & ServiceListItem:** Ensure the list items are well-spaced and easy to read on small screens.
  - **ContactForm:** Adjust form fields and button sizes for better usability on mobile devices.

## 2. Technical Notes

- **Breakpoint:** All mobile-specific styles will be applied to screens with a `max-width` of `767px` or via a `min-width: 768px` media query for desktop styles, following a mobile-first approach.
- **Menu Behavior:** The mobile navigation menu will be implemented as a full-screen overlay with a close button.
- **Testing:** All responsive changes should be tested on actual devices or through browser developer tools to ensure a consistent experience.

## 3. Risks and Dependencies

- **Risk:** Applying responsive styles may have unintended side effects on existing layouts. Thorough testing across all pages is required.
