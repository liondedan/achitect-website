Feature: Homepage
  As a prospective client
  I want to see a visually appealing homepage
  So that I can get a quick sense of the architect's style and professionalism

  Scenario: Visitor sees key homepage elements
    Given I am a visitor on the homepage
    When the page loads
    Then I should see the main headline
    And I should see a brief introductory text
    And I should see a high-quality hero image
    And I should see the main navigation links
