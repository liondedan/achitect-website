# Technical Plan: [SITE-001] Homepage with Next.js

## 1. High-Level Strategy

The strategy is to build a server-rendered website using Next.js, which is ideal for performance and SEO. We will leverage Next.js features like Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), and optimized components (`next/image`, `next/link`). The application will be structured for easy deployment on Vercel, which is tightly integrated with Next.js.

## 2. Engineering Tasks

- **Task 1: Initialize Next.js Project**
  - Use the command `npx create-next-app@latest` to bootstrap a new Next.js application.
  - This will create the standard project structure, including `pages/`, `public/`, and `styles/` directories.

- **Task 2: Create the Homepage**
  - The homepage will be located at `pages/index.js`.
  - This file will contain the main React component for the homepage.
  - Add SEO-friendly `<Head>` tags from `next/head` for the page title and meta description.

- **Task 3: Create a Reusable Header Component**
  - Create a new component, e.g., `components/Header.js`.
  - This component will contain the `<header>` and `<nav>` elements.
  - Use the `next/link` component for navigation links ("Home", "Portfolio", "About Me", "Process & Services", "Contact") to enable fast, client-side routing.

- **Task 4: Build the Hero Section**
  - Within the `pages/index.js` component, add the JSX for the hero section.
  - Use an `<h1>` for the main headline and a `<p>` for the introductory text.
  - Use the `next/image` component to serve the hero image, ensuring it is optimized for performance.

- **Task 5: Apply Basic Styling**
  - Use CSS Modules (`styles/Home.module.css`) or a global stylesheet (`styles/globals.css`) for styling.
  - Add clean, professional styles for typography, colors, and layout.
  - Ensure the layout is responsive and works well on mobile devices.

- **Task 6: Prepare for Vercel Deployment**
  - Create a new repository on a Git provider (e.g., GitHub).
  - Push the Next.js project to the repository.
  - Create a new project on Vercel and link it to the Git repository for continuous deployment.

## 3. Technical Notes & Considerations

- **Note:** The `next/image` component requires specifying the width and height of images for layout stability and performance.
- **Note:** Navigation links will point to their respective routes (e.g., `/portfolio`, `/about`). Next.js will handle the page creation.
- **Note:** The initial focus is on structure and core content. Advanced styling and animations are out of scope.

## 4. Risks & Dependencies

- **Dependency:** Final copy for the headline and introductory text is needed.
- **Dependency:** A high-quality hero image is required.
- **Dependency:** A Vercel account and a Git repository are required for deployment.
